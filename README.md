## Feedback for the enhance team:

- Quick start: my-element.js does not work on **Windows**
  - HMR doesn't work on WSL
  - Changes in the public folder require restarting the dev server
- Eslint complaining about tabs vs spaces
  - No reliable way to format template strings
- No TypeScript support? 🙁
- head.mjs has no html for syntax highlighting
- what is the .arc file? no docs
- CSS layers don't seem to work
- bundling is a bit confusing
- 🚩 _`@enhance/enhance` utility requires duplication of markup_
- not obvious how to reuse elements in client side enhance
- how to set attributes on the html/body element on the server?
- It's not clear that styles.css is auto generated and should not be modified
- "Internal server error" when style tag is empty
